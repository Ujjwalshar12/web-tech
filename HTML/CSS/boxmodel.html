    <!-- box model  
     for each tag has box model and every element in html follows box model 
     css box model is essential a box which wraps around every html element
     box model consist of 4 parts
     1.content area -
     the area which is created when we give width or height 
     2.padding
     the internal area/space between content area and border
     padding is shorthand for them to give in one the first value is top right bottom left
     when we pass 2 values the 1 is for top and bottom and 2 is for right and left 
     when we pass 1 then all 4
     we have 4 properties 
     padding-left
     padding-right
     padding-top
     padding-bottom
     3.border
     the area which is created when we give border
     same values for border also
     4.margin
     the area between border and other elements
     same as padding 



     while giving padding and border the size increase of the box 
     we use box-sizing 
     box-sizing:border-box - no change in size as it includes both in content area
     box-sizing:content-box - default value size increases as padding and border are added 
     outside the content
